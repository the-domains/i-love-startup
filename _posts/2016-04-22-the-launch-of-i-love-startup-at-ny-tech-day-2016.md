# The Launch of "I Love Startup" at NY Tech Day 2016

Let me take you on little journey.

During NY Tech Day 2016 I debuted my new personal brand, I Love Startup. To dress the part and add to the image, I attended the countries largest Tech event in bright red denim. Walking the convention floor, I spoke to many new and upcoming startup founders and old friends alike who all responded very positively to the brand, several of which quipped, "_I am even surprised that domain was available!_"

It has been a long time coming. For years I have known I needed a personal brand independant of anything I create or get involved in but being as busy as I tend to be, it fell low on the priority list.

During the past year I made the decision to really put some effort into crafting as-close-as-possible a perfect personal brand. I was overdue and NYC is hyper competitive... If you don't uniquely stand out, you will blend in and fade away unremarkably in New Yorker's minds just as many ads, companies and products do.

I have been working tirelessly in the background on this side project for the better part of the past year and ironically it didn't culminate until I was developing new branding for another project, just _days_ before NY Tech Day 2016\.

For me, the challenge was huge: how do I summarize my lifelong dedication to entrepreneurship and startup... a career that formally began in 1994, spans three decades, saw the rise of the Internet, a multi-million dollar exit before the rise and fall of the dot com boom, the Millennium and Y2K, the market crash in 2008 and the subsequent boom in startup we know today?

Earlier this week on Monday, I had gotten off a conference call with my strategy team in Connecticut regarding the rebranding of one of our event series' and was mind mapping for conceptual ideas when the thought that I just simply love startup and the process. It was so simple, clean and succinct. But not for the event, it rang true and deep with me personally.

I forged on with the project at hand, trying to stay on task and fighting my ADHD urge to spin off on a tangent about all the ways I love startup but after an few hours just couldn't let it go in the back of my mind. I reluctantly did a search for the domain, full well knowing a domain name such as that surely had to have been spoken for and if it was available, would surely be for sale somewhere for a five or six figure price.. To my amazement, it was available for sale and less than what I expected... I pinched myself!

A unique opportunity was knocking at my door and here it was... on a platter! Many times I have been told I am lucky, which I would always shrug off and take small offense to. I respond that luck is really hard work, a small series of conscious steps and by calling it luck you write off the work part of it. First, you make a decision to do something consciously... in this case due diligence on the availability of a domain, even though you know it most likely is gone. Second, realizing you are in the right place at the right time. Many fail at this, they simply don't or can't recognize what is right in front of them at that moment. In this case it was recognizing the potential of owning a prolific domain for a lifelong serial entrepreneur and angel investor. Last is having the wherewithal to take advantage of the opportunity once you realize you are in the right place at the right time. In this case, it was having the funds available to make the purchase of an expensive domain name (_I will leave the sum paid undisclosed_) that I would use as my personal brand. If you can recreate these steps yourself, others will also tell you that you are lucky.

Being that I am very entrenched in NYC as well as Lower Fairfield County CT and my new domain ILoveStartup.com in hand, one of the first images to pop in my head was the famous NY Tourism logo "I ♥️ NY" created by the iconic Milton Glaser in 1977\. One of the most world renowned and best executed logos of all time, it became inspiration and a natural fit for the brand, image, my background and history (my family is from NYC, I grew up around New York my entire life and did most of my startup work in and/or around NYC).

Super excited, it was time to show it to the world and what better place than NY TechDay 2016, the largest tech event in the country. With just less than 24 hours until the event, I called on the help of Steve Alpert of New York Printing Solutions, Inc. on 38th between 7th and 8th to print some business cards same day. After a quick check with the production department, they accepted my job, I whipped out the Adobe Illustrator files they needed and literally in four hours (!) had beautiful business cards adorned with arguably the most epic entrepreneur's email address: peter@ilovestartup.com

It's been a long, "identity-less" road for 22 years but the wait has been worth it... I can't imagine a better brand for myself because I am truly and completely dedicated to the entrepreneur and the world of startup... it has become my life mission to positively move the needle on the one and only metric that really matters... after all the hoopla, still roughly 9 out of 10 startups fail.
